Description:
* Discrete not-optimal learning of GP to quantify exceedance probability
(failure probability) based on the U-function (the probability of
misclassification). Low-dimensional representation substitutes
high-dimensional initial uncertainties to defined initial waves for
low-dimensional classification factors, which are used then as design
parameters for learning.
