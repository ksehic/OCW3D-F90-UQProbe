Description:
* Discrete not-optimal learning of GP to quantify exceedance probability
(failure probability) based on the U-function (the probability of
misclassification). Low-dimensional representation substitutes
high-dimensional initial uncertainties to defined initial waves for
low-dimensional classification factors, which are used then as design
parameters for learning.

1. Install OceanWave3D via https://github.com/boTerpPaulsen/OceanWave3D-Fortran90
2. You will need to have MATLAB2019B or similar.
3. Download UQ files to your folder.
4. Open OC3D_GP.m and runOC.m and specify OceanWave3D run command at 178 and 23 line.
5. Follow comments
6. Run
